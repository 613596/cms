                            <p>As students or their parents begin to explore their postsecondary education options, they may begin to wonder about the difference between colleges and universities. Many people assume that college refers to a private institution and a university refers to a state-funded school. Other people may think that a university provides a better education than a college. In reality, the difference between a college and a university is much more difficult to define.</p> <br>
                            <p>A college is a smaller institution that typically offers undergraduate degrees. Some colleges, such as community colleges and junior colleges, may offer only two-year degrees. Most colleges offer bachelor’s degrees, and some colleges also have associate degrees.</p>
